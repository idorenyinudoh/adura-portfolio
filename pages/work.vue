      Over the past few months, I have busied myself with sharpening my skills and polishing my craft so that when the time came for me to create a portfolio, I would be proud of my work, be confident in its value and believe in its ability to make a remarkable contribution.

      Here are some projects I've worked on. I hope they inspire you and most importantly, I hope you are impressed by them. Make yourself comfortable and enjoy the show.
