  <TextBaseP>
    On my journey to be an authority in my field, I've come to understand that while there are guiding procedures to which I follow to creating intuitive solutions with my designs, I've learnt that it is a non-linear and iterative process. What this means is that design solutions are continuous due to human wants being insatiable so these processes are often revisited from time to time even after originally carried out.
