      title: 'Wireframing and prototyping',
      description: 'After the problem was understood, I then proceeded to creating sketches of how the new feature(s) would look before finally moving on to design software. PS: I especially enjoy this process using pen and paper.'

      title: 'Matching design with existing endpoints',

      title: 'Delayed time of design implementation',
      description: 'When in agile environment, tasks come at certain priorities and often, upon completion of a high priority task (design wise), it sometimes doesn\'t get pushed to development immediately as there are often tasks of higher priority for the engineers.'

    'The design process is never linear.',
    'Feedback isn\'t personal. Early on in my design process, I used to take feedback as personal attack but I learned to consciously make my design iteration not an extension of me and constantly remind myself that we all have the same goals in mind â€” be it from a teammate or from a superior.',
