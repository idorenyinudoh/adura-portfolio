    <BaseUl>
      <li><span class="font-medium">Problem statement, understanding and research:</span> This was the very first step in my design process as I had to carefully explore the existing user interface, the current website to understand their services and ask questions within the team to make sure the design solves real world problems.</li>
      <li><span class="font-medium">Design system:</span> Create a global design system that caters to both the mobile application and back-office and customise it to fit SCIART's brand identity.</li>
      <li><span class="font-medium">Wireframing and prototyping:</span> Creating the design system, I then proceeded to creating sketches of how the new feature(s) will look before finally moving on to design software. PS: I especially enjoy this process using pen and paper.</li>
      <li><span class="font-medium">High fidelity design iterations:</span> This process involves ideating the low fidelity designs (wireframes) into useful and usable interface.</li>
      <li><span class="font-medium">Review and further iterations:</span> The design is then reviewed by the CEO and when green-lit, pushed for development.</li>

    <BaseH2 text="CHALLENGES" class="!mb-6 md:!mb-8 lg:!mb-10" />
    <BaseUl>
      <li>Designing effective ways to visualise financial data and analytics within the admin back-office can be complex.</li>
      <li>Due to the fact that where was an existing iteration of the product, I had to go back and forth to make sure this new iteration solves the issues the existing one had.</li>
      <li>Working within such short timeframe was highly challenging and I was able to push myself to meet the deadline though we had a few close calls.</li>
    </BaseUl>
    <BaseH2 text="LESSONS LEARNED" class="!mb-6 md:!mb-8 lg:!mb-10" />
    <BaseUl>
      <li>I actively sought and incorporated feedback from a diverse set of stakeholders, including users, developers, and product managers, to refine my designs.</li>
      <li>I learned to maintain well-organised design documentation, style guides, and UI component libraries to streamline collaboration and future updates.</li>
      <li>I especially learned what it meant to work with friends and reminded me the true power of collaborations.</li>
